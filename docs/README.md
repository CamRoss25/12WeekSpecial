# Introduction: A Noble Thank You for Joining Us on This Quest!

Hark! Fair traveler, thou art most welcome to the grand unveiling of our humble work—*a tale of wonder and innovation*! We, Camren and Bella, extend our heartfelt thanks for taking the time to gaze upon our portfolio, which doth present the movement of the noble Create3 robot, as it embarks on its most daring adventure: mapping an area through the ancient art of LIDAR and the powerful connection known as ROS (Robot Operating System).

### What is the Create3 Robot?
Lo and behold, the Create3 robot! A mechanical steed of great precision, crafted by the masters at iRobot. With sensors sharp and wheels swift, this wondrous device aids in the noble task of autonomous navigation, proving itself a worthy companion for any robotic quest. It is a marvel of engineering, ready to chart the unknown and conquer challenges with its intelligence.

### What is ROS?
Ah, ROS—Robot Operating System! A magical framework, open to all, that binds the various elements of the robotic realm together. Through its power, the Create3 can communicate with its mighty LIDAR and other enchanted sensors, performing feats of mapping and localization with great finesse. A true marvel of the modern age!

So, brave soul, as you journey through this portfolio, prepare to witness how we harnessed the might of ROS and the Create3 robot to map an area in a wondrous display of technological prowess!
